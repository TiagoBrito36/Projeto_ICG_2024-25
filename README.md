## Description

Last Stand: Apocalypse is a wave-based first-person shooter where players must survive increasingly difficult rounds of enemies. The game features various enemy types, weapon systems, and a complete game with progression.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js** - 3D rendering engine
- **JavaScript** - Core programming language
- **HTML5 & CSS** - Structure and styling

## Features

- **First-person combat system** with multiple weapons:
  - Knife for melee attacks
  - Pistol with ammunition management
  
- **Enemy varieties** with unique behaviors:
  - Normal enemies (basic movement and attacks)
  - Tank enemies (slower but more health)
  - Ranged enemies (attack from distance)
  - Boss enemies (powerful end-round opponents)

- **Round progression** with increasing difficulty
  
- **Complete game systems**:
  - Player health and shield
  - Inventory management
  - Collision detection
  - Particle effects

- **Responsive UI**:
  - Dynamic HUD showing health and ammo
  - Inventory system
  - Pause menu
  - Customizable character

## Academic Context

This project was developed for the Introduction to Computer Graphics course at University of Aveiro during the 2024-25 academic year. It demonstrates practical application of 3D graphics programming concepts including:

- 3D rendering techniques
- Camera manipulation
- Collision detection
- Animation systems
- Lighting and materials
- User interface integration with 3D environments
